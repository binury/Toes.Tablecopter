*Take flight and even bring a friend*

## Usage

### Flight checklist

1. Press `T` (default) to toggle the Tablecopter on or off and `Ctrl + T` to change the copter mode.
2. Sit to descend- as a fledgling Tablecopter pilot **this is how you will normally land** (and completely disable upward thrust)
3. Jump to climb. Tap this to maintain altitude while moving around, kinda like a jetpack. You'll see.
4. You brought your parachute right...?

### Tips
- Disable sprint and use sneak walk for 'delicate maneuvers'
    - Right turns are impossible; left turns are your friend (due to collision/shape of `Therapist Chair`)
- Jumping will expedite liftoff
- For an emergency landing try diving
- Typing while flying is not advised due to potentially inadvertently steering the copter

## Known Issues

- *Behavior is likely to be undesirable if size is unlocked and the player's skeleton is excessively small or large!*
